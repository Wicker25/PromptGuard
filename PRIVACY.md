# Privacy Policy

**PromptGuard** is a browser extension that detects and replaces personal data in your messages before they are sent to AI chatbots.

## Data Handling

- All processing happens **locally in your browser**. No data is sent to any external server.
- Detected personal data (emails, phone numbers, names, etc.) is stored temporarily in your browser's local storage to enable placeholder restoration within the same chat session.
- No analytics, telemetry, or tracking of any kind is collected.
- No data is shared with third parties.

## Permissions

- **activeTab**: Used to access the current tab so the extension can detect and redact personal data in chat messages.
- **storage**: Used to store placeholder-to-original-value mappings and user preferences (e.g., excluded items, extension status) locally in the browser.
- **Host permissions (chatgpt.com, chat.openai.com)**: Required to run the content script on supported AI chat platforms.

## Changes

If this policy is updated, the changes will be reflected in this document.

## Contact

If you have questions about this policy, you can reach out via the extension's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/wicker25/PromptGuard).
